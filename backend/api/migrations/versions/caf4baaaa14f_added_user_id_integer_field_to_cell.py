    # downgrade writes None as the constraint name although  it does
    # not exist. Self breaks. To fix, comment out the drop_constraint
    # line and run the downgrade. Then manually delete the foreign_key.
    # Hopefully, we can fix this down the line as this downgrade might
    # be neccesary for development of this implementation.
