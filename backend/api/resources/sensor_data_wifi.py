"""Sensor endpoint for requests directly uploading data

The measurement data is POSTed to this resource as protobuf encoded binary data
which is decoded into a dictionary containing measured values. The data is
inserted into the appropriate table in the database. A HTTP response is sent
back containing protobuf binary data with the response message indicating status
of data.
